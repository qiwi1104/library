# Library

Used to manage the books I want to read/have already read.

There are 3 languages - Russian, English, and Spanish; 2 book types - Finished Books and Books To Read; and a special Additional Dates type used when a book has been read more than one time.

## 

Books I want to read have the "_found_" property which represents the date when a book has been added to the list.

In addition to the "_found_" property, Finished Books have the "_start_" and "_end_" properties which represent the date when I started reading a book and the date I finished it.
